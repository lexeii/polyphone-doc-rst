Building Polyphone for Ubuntu
=============================

Use these instructions if you cannot install Polyphone on your Linux distribution with the available installers in the section “Download_”.
This method has been tested with Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial).


Prerequisite
------------

The following libraries are required:

* qt (``qt5-default`` + ``libqt5svg5-dev``)
* alsa (``libasound2-dev``)
* jack (``libjack-jackd2-dev``)
* portaudio (``portaudio19-dev``)
* rtmidi (``librtmidi-dev``)
* stk (``libstk0-dev``)
* qcustomplot (``libqcustomplot-dev``)
* vorbis (``libvorbis-dev``)
* ogg (``libogg-dev``)
* flac (``libflac-dev``)
* ssl (``libssl-dev``)

Use :program:`synaptic` to install them.


Build
-----

In the root directory of the project, open a terminal and build Polyphone by running the following command::

  qmake && make

An executable file :file:`polyphone` in the directory :file:`RELEASE` should then appear if everything went right.

In the case where libraries such as RtMidi, Stk, QCustomPlot are missing or are not in a compatible version in your distribution, you can edit the :file:`.pro` file to use local copies of them.
To do this, uncomment the corresponding lines::

  #DEFINES += USE_LOCAL_RTMIDI

will become

::

  DEFINES += USE_LOCAL_RTMIDI

for instance (with no leading “#”).

.. note::
   If you are using :program:`Qt Creator`, the project may be opened via its :file:`.pro` file present in the root directory.
   Take care :guilabel:`shadow build` is not checked (project properties).
