Settings
========

The software preferences are accessible either
from the :ref:`home screen <home screen>` or
from the :ref:`menu <menu shortcuts>`. They are divided into five sections:

* :ref:`general settings`
* :ref:`interface settings`
* :ref:`sound settings`
* :ref:`keyboard settings`
* :ref:`repository settings`

.. _general settings:

General
-------

The “:guilabel:`General`” section allows the modification of the following
parameters:

:Audio back-end: Specifies the audio back-end used to play samples.
  :abbr:`JACK (JACK Audio Connection Kit)`
  and :abbr:`ASIO (Audio Stream Input/Output)` drivers (the latter for Windows
  only) may be chosen.
:Buffer size: Specifies the buffer size used
  for :abbr:`JACK (JACK Audio Connection Kit)`
  and :abbr:`ASIO (Audio Stream Input/Output)` drivers. A small buffer results
  in a small latency, but the sound may become scratchy.
:MIDI input: Specifies the :abbr:`MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)`
  input controlling the virtual keyboard.

Moreover, it is possible to check the following options:

:Sample import\: trim to loop: When importing a sample, data located after
  the end of loop are automatically removed (same effect as the tool
  “:ref:`sample tool trimloop`”).
:Wav file import\: remove blank at start: When importing a sample, any blank
  area located before the beginning of the attack is automatically removed
  (same effect as the tool “:ref:`sample tool removeblank`”).
:Stereo editing\: change linked sample: When editing one side
  of a stereo sample, the other side is automatically edited the same.
  The same applies when editing a stereo instrument division:
  the division corresponding to the other channel (with the same note
  and velocity ranges) is edited the same.

.. _interface settings:

Interface
---------

This section shows options related to the interface of the software:

:Language: The language may be changed here (a restart of the software
  is required).
:Key names: Keys may be named depending on their number (according
  to :abbr:`MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)` specification),
  or depending on the name of middle C (C3, C4 or C5). Key names may comprise
  sharps or flats.
:Sort divisions: The division order within an instrument or a preset
  can be changed here.
:Decorations: Background decorations in some lists can be deactivated
  for readability.
:Color theme: Different predefined color themes are available for customizing
  the appearance of Polyphone. A manual selection of colors is also possible.

.. _sound settings:

Sound
-----

The “:guilabel:`Sound`” section makes it possible to modify the chorus and
reverb of the synth, along with its global volume. The global volume may be
changed with the volume :abbr:`MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)`
controller if an external keyboard is connected.
