Configuration summaries
=======================

The configuration summaries provide an overview of all elements contained in
a soundfont. They are accessible via the headers :guilabel:`Samples`,
:guilabel:`Instruments` et :guilabel:`Presets` in the :ref:`tree <tree>`,
and allow the visualization of their corresponding elements.

Information gathered in these pages can be used to support inspections within
large soundfonts.

   Sample configuration summary

For each sample, this page allows for example to perform the following checks:

* Is it used?
* Is its total duration (and possibly its loop duration) long enough?
* Has the tuning been done?
* Is it properly linked in stereo?
* Is the sampling rate high enough for a good audio quality?

.. _conf summ instrument:

   Instrument configuration summary

For each instrument, this page allows for example to perform the following
checks:

* Is it used?
* Are the numbers of linked samples, parameters and modulators consistent?
* Are the key and velocity ranges correct?
* Have the samples been properly attenuated?
* Is the loop playback on?
* Have the chorus and reverb settings not been forgotten?

.. _conf summ preset:

Presets
-------

When clicking on the :guilabel:`Presets` header of a soundfont in the
:ref:`tree <tree>`, the preset configuration summary appears.

   Preset configuration summary

For each preset, this page allows for example to perform the following checks:

* Have the bank and preset numbers been properly filled?
* Are the numbers of linked instruments, parameters and modulators consistent?
* Are the key and velocity ranges correct?
* Have the instruments been accurately attenuated?
* Have the chorus and reverb settings (as offset) not been forgotten?
