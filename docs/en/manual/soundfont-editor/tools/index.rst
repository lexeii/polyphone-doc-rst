Tools
=====

Once you understand how soundfonts work (through the different :ref:`editors <editing pages>`), tools are probably what you should care of.
They are all designed to fasten / automate the editing and to avoid common errors or imprecision that a human usually does.

Tools are all available in a menu that is displayed when clicking on the toolbox icon in the :ref:`toolbar <toolbar edit>`.
The content of this menu depends on the selection in the :ref:`tree <tree>`: first on the kind of selection (as described below) but also on the number of selected elements.
A few tools cannot process multiple elements so they will be hidden with a multiple selection.
