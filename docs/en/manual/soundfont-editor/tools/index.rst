Tools
=====

Once you understand how soundfonts work (through the different
:ref:`editors <editing pages>`), tools are probably what you should care of.
They are all designed to fasten / automate the editing and to avoid common
errors or imprecision that a human usually does.

Tools are all available in a menu that is displayed when clicking
on the toolbox icon in the :ref:`toolbar <toolbar edit>`. The content
of this menu depends on the selection in the :ref:`tree <tree>`: first
on the kind of selection (as described below) but also on the number
of selected elements. A few tools cannot process multiple elements so they
will be hidden with a multiple selection.
