.. _sample tools:

Sample tools
============

When one or more samples are selected in the :ref:`tree <tree>`,
the :ref:`tool menu <tool menu>` contains several tools sorted in 4 categories:

* :ref:`sample tools analyze`
* :ref:`sample tools files`
* :ref:`sample tools processing`
* :ref:`sample tools stereo`

Using the tools simultaneously on several samples is possible (with a multi
selection).

.. _sample tools analyze:

Analyze
-------

.. _sample tool peakfrequencies:

Show peak frequencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tool gathers the information on the peak frequencies of all selected
samples, and the results can be exported in a .csv file. The peak frequencies
are visible in the editing page of :ref:`samples <sample editor frequency>`.

.. figure:: images/tool_show_peak_frequencies.png

.. _sample tools files:

Files
-----

.. _sample tool wavexport:

Wav export
^^^^^^^^^^

After having selected a destination directory, all selected samples
will be exported as .wav files.

.. _sample tools processing:

Sample processing
-----------------

.. _sample tool autoloop:

Auto loop
^^^^^^^^^

The software seeks a stable area of the sample and then artificially creates
a loop. A sound segment is copied with a cross-fade, so that the transition
at the join location is as smooth as possible.

To assign loop points automatically:

#. click in the :ref:`tree <tree>` on the sample to be looped,
#. in the editing page of :ref:`samples <sample editor>`:

   * position the start and end of the loop in the graphic (WAV display area)
     around a stable area, or
   * let the tool determine automatically a stable area by defining 0 as loop
     start and loop end,

#. in the :guilabel:`Tools` menu select :guilabel:`Sample`,
   :guilabel:`Auto loop`,
#. press the :guilabel:`Play` button with the loop option checked,
#. if the loop points found are not suitable you can :ref:`undo <toolbar edit>`
   the operation, try repositioning them manually around a stable area and then
   use the :guilabel:`Auto loop` function again.

The tool needs to find a stable area of more than 0.25 seconds. If it fails,
a warning message appears indicating that no loop can be found. In this case
it is possible to specify manually a stable area of more than 0.25 seconds
and retry the tool, or try to find the loop points manually.

.. warning::
   This tool modifies the original sample. Modifications can be undone
   via the “:ref:`undo <toolbar edit>`” function, but if the file is saved
   and Polyphone is closed there is no way to step back.

.. note::
   By default, the looping is disabled in an instrument. To hear it, you must
   select |loop on| in the Loop playback parameter row of either the Global
   or individual notes columns in the Parameters Table. |loop on| turns it On,
   |loop off| turns it Off. |loop on + end| turns the looping On and the sample
   will play to the end after a key is released.

.. _sample tool volume:

Change volume
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can change the volume in three different ways:

* in adding a certain amount of dB (positive or negative amount),
* in multiplying the signal by a number,
* in normalizing the signal so that the maximum of this signal represents some
  percentage of the maximum intensity.

.. _sample tool externalcommand:

External command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tool allows you to use an external command or program to edit a sample.
You don't need to export and re-import a sample into Polyphone anymore,
everything is done automatically:

#. download an editing software for wav files such as ``audacity`` or ``sweep``
   (Linux),
#. use the tool :guilabel:`External command` for one or more samples,
#. fill the command line in the right field to call the external software
   (you may need to read the documentation of this software),
#. edit the sample(s) with the external tool,
#. save the modified version of the wav file(s) with the external tool and
   close it,
#. the sample(s) will be automatically loaded into the soundfont.

.. _sample tool filter:

Filter frequencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you use this tool, a window will be displayed showing the frequencies
contained in the sample(s) you selected. You can then use the mouse to draw
a red area. Everything that is in this area will be removed: this means that
you can manually decrease of remove some frequencies.

.. figure:: images/tool_filter_frequencies.png
   :alt: Filter frequency tool

.. note::
   This filter is not common since it cuts frequencies in a hard way.
   This tool can be useful to design a brick-wall filter but in most cases you
   will probably want to use the :ref:`equalizer <sample editor equalizer>`.

.. _sample tool removeblank:

Remove blank at start
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any blank area before the sample begins is eliminated. This reduces the time
before the sound is heard.

.. figure:: images/remove_blank.png
   :alt: Remove blank at start

.. note::
   This tool may be applied automatically each time a sample is imported,
   according to the software :ref:`preferences <general settings>`.

.. _sample tool transpose:

Transpose
^^^^^^^^^

The tool asks for a shift in semitones and then re-samples the sound to change
the pitch.

.. figure:: images/tool_transpose_smpl.png
   :alt: Transpose tool

.. _sample tool trimloop:

Trim to end of loop
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a loop is defined for the selected sample, the software will cut the sound
after the end of the loop (leaving a small margin at the end).

.. figure:: images/trim_to_loop.png
   :alt: Trim to loop

.. note::
   This tool may be applied automatically each time a sample is imported,
   according to the software :ref:`preferences <general settings>`.

.. _sample tools stereo:

Stereo samples
--------------

.. _sample tool balance:

Balance adjustment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the sample is linked to another one (stereo), the software can equalize
the mean intensity of the two samples to adjust the balance.
This will then be easier to accurately pan a sample in an
:ref:`instrument <instrument editor>`.

.. _sample tool link:

Link all stereo samples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Among the selected samples, samples whose names only differ by the last letter
(R / L) are automatically linked. For example, if in a soundfont two samples
are called ``bassoon45L`` and ``bassoon45R``, ``bassoon45L`` will be recognized
as the left part of ``bassoon45R`` and ``bassoon45R`` will be recognized
as the right part of ``bassoon45L``.

With this information the right panning will be used when these samples
are added in an instrument. You can also enjoy the simultaneous editing of left
and right parts in the instrument :ref:`table <instrument editor table>`
if the stereo editing is activated in the :ref:`settings <general settings>`.

.. warning::
   This tool can break existing links if the names don't match the rule above.

.. _sample tool unlink:

Unlink all stereo samples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All selected samples that are linked (stereo) are unlinked.

Thus, all samples will be processed as mono sounds and they will all have
the same panning if they are added in an instrument. The stereo editing,
if activated in the :ref:`settings <general settings>`, will not be applicable
anymore.
