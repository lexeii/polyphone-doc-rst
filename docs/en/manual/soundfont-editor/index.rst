   :alt: Soundfont editor

A soundfont editor is made of:

* a :ref:`tree <tree>` on the left, representing the architecture
  of the soundfont;
* a :ref:`toolbar <toolbar>` on the top (in blue in the picture);
* a main area that can either contain an :ref:`editing page <editing pages>`
  or an :ref:`configuration summary <conf summaries>`, depending on what
  is selected in the :ref:`tree <tree>`.
