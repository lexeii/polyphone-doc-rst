Preset editor
=============

When clicking on one or more preset(s) in the :ref:`tree <tree>`, the editing
page of presets appears. A preset is a combination of one or more instruments
and is the element visible from outside a :ref:`soundfont <sf2 format>`.

Similarly to the :ref:`instrument editor <instrument editor>`, several parts
are present:

* the table,
* the range editor when the button :guilabel:`Edit ranges`
  of the :ref:`toolbar <toolbar view>` is clicked,
* the modulator section.

If only one preset is selected, the page allows the editing of the global
parameters of the preset and the parameters of all its divisions.

In the case where several presets are selected, the global parameters of each
of these presets can be edited.


Differences with the instruments
--------------------------------

The parameters edited here are said relative unlike parameters of an instrument
which, except in special cases, are said absolute. Values of a preset
parameters are added or multiplied to the instrument parameters that compose
it. Some parameters are not editable at the preset level:

* loop playback,
* root key,
* exclusive class,
* fixed key,
* fixed velocity,
* the four offsets.

A preset is identified by a preset number and bank number, this combination
being unique and adjustable below the table. Each bank comprises 127 presets.

The last bank (128) is usually used for percussion kits.
