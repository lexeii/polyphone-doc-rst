Opening a soundfont
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Three ways for opening a soundfont:

* a click on :guilabel:`Open a file` opens a file browser, the allowed file
  to select having the extension sf2, sf3, sfArk or sfz (the different formats
  are described :ref:`here <sf formats>`);
* a click on :guilabel:`Create a soundfont` opens an empty soundfont,
  everything is to be done from scratch;
* a double-click on a soundfont from the history re-open it.

When a soundfont is open, a new tab appears with
a :ref:`soundfont editor <sf editor>` inside.

Shortcuts
^^^^^^^^^

Three buttons are located at the bottom of the left part:

:Documentation: Open a web browser for reading the Polyphone documentation_.
:Forum: Open a web browser with the URL of the Polyphone forum_.
:Settings: Open the :ref:`settings <settings>` of the software in a new tab.
