test and possibly re-use soundfonts.

Soundfont description
---------------------

Opening a soundfont description can be made with a double-click on a cell in
the daily soundfonts of the :ref:`home screen <home screen>` or in the
`soundfont browser <sf browse_>`_.
A Premium account is required for soundfonts that are not in the daily
soundfonts. Connecting Polyphone to your account is possible in the

The description of a soundfont is made of:

* a **header**, in which you can find the title, the number of comments, the
  number of downloads and the rating,
* a **left part**, comprising the author name, a date, the license type
  (please take care of this), the category and other attributes that
  characterize the soundfont,
* a **central part**, displaying a textual description, the list of files
  to download and possible comments.

--------

For downloading a file, click on the icon :guilabel:`download` next to its
file name in the section :guilabel:`Downloads`. You will see the download

possible to open it in a :ref:`soundfont editor <sf editor>` by clicking
on the icon :guilabel:`open`.

It is possible from the menu to clear the completed downloads.
If everything is cleared, the download menu disappears.
